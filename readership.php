<p>The Timazi Readership Challenge is a book reading program designed to build a healthy 
reading culture among high school students. The program engages students in different 
schools that have a pre-paid subscription to read a carefully selected book after which 
they write a guided report which enter into a national essay writing competition based on 
the book. Thereafter, a selected team of judges consisting of local Christian leaders and teachers grade the reports.
 The contest culminates with an award gala on the last weekend of June every year.</p>
